Data on case count, death rates, and recovery rates per day was sourced from Johns Hopkins Medical School (</span><span class="c5">Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center</span><span>, 2020). Data analysis was performed in Python, using the pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and datetime packages for data importation and visualization. In order to better compare the growth of COVID-19 in multiple countries differing in initial onset of the disease, the data was also reformatted to reflect daily case counts as a function of days since the first or tenth case, rather than by date. Total confirmed case counts per country were also plotted on a log-linear scale, and the sklearn linear_model package was used to linearly fit the natural logarithm of total case counts per country as a function of the number of days since the first case during two different time intervals: an </span><span class="c5">early </span><span>and a </span><span class="c5">later </span><span>period. The early period was defined with respect to the first day on which there were 10 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in each affected nation, and was 12 days in length.

Akin to China, the South Korean response to COVID-19 has been analyzed as a perhaps more transferrable solution for relatively democratic nations currently at the heart of the epidemic </span><span><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?TA0ilh&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1592855522450000">(Kenneth Rapoza, 2020)</a></span><span class="c4">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5 c9"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9 c6 c5">The State of COVID-19: A Quantitative Analysis </span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c4">In Figure 1, we plot the total confirmed COVID-19 case count within six countries. The graphs are both sigmoidally shaped, indicating an initially exponentially growing - but later decreasing - total confirmed COVID-19 case count. The same cannot be said for other nations, including Germany, Spain, Italy, and the US, for which the graphs look exclusively exponential. Interestingly, the data also reveal that the number of days since the first predicted case in South Korea and China are not consistent: whereas South Korea&rsquo;s confirmed case count appears to flatline after only 60 days since the first confirmed case, it takes double that amount of time in China for a similar effect to be discerned in the graph (Figure 1B). Numerically, the relatively unchanging total confirmed case count of COVID-19 over time within these countries falls in line with the understanding that the pandemic is reaching its end in China and South Korea. </span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c4">The relative quantity of recovered cases to confirmed cases of COVID-19 is an informative metric to gauge the temporal &lsquo;stage&rsquo; of COVID-19 in a given country. &nbsp;Of China&rsquo;s 81,897 confirmed cases, 74,720 have recovered; of the 9,332 confirmed cases in South Korea, over 4,500 have recovered. Comparatively, the US reports that less than 1,000 of the 101,657 confirmed cases have recovered. Indeed, the relative quantity of deaths relative to confirmed cases in the US is high among the affected nations (Figure 2). Additionally, on March 29th, the US reported more confirmed deaths caused by COVID-19 than recoveries, unlike any other nation analyzed in the present report. Although they do not report as many deaths relative to recoveries, Italy, Spain, and Germany similarly report a meager recovery count relative to the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, indicating that these countries are not near the end stage of the epidemic. </span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c4">Notably, in China, the ongoing percentage of recovered cases closely resembles the sigmoidal trajectory of the total confirmed cases over time, although offset by approximately two weeks (Figure 3). This evidences the relative completion of the pandemic in China, as the relative slowing of the growth of the total case count has allowed the recovery rate to increase and eventually match the case count. In South Korea, the ongoing percentage of recovered cases may be following a similarly sigmoidal trajectory, especially given the recent sustained increases in recoveries and the relatively unchanging total confirmed case count. In Germany, Italy, and Spain, the recovery rates are just now beginning to rise. In the US, the recovery rate remains relatively unchanging. Instead, the death rate is increasing more than the recovery rate.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c4">These data suggest that China, South Korea, Italy, Germany, Spain, and the US can be categorized on the grounds of their relative temporal stage within the epidemic. Broadly defined, China and South Korea can be conceptualized as having curbed the epidemic, and Italy, Germany, Spain, and the US can be thought of as currently being at the heart of it. Yet multiple parameters relating to the United States - including the unchanging, relatively small recovery rate and the relatively higher death rate - suggest that the US is not operating on a similar timescale to Italy, Germany, and Spain, and may be at a distinctly earlier stage of the epidemic. </span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span>To more robustly test this phenomenon, we linearly fit the logarithmized number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 during two windows of time: an </span><span class="c5">early</span><span>&nbsp;period, corresponding to the initial growth of the disease, and a </span><span class="c5">later</span><span>&nbsp;period, corresponding to the growth of the disease in recent weeks (Figure 4A). The slopes of these linear fits - a measure of the growth of COVID-19 during each of the early and later windows of time - significantly decreased in China, South Korea, Italy, Spain, and Germany, but </span><span class="c5">increased</span><span>&nbsp;in the US (Figure 4B). Thus, the US can be categorized separately from the other countries, in that it is relatively at the earliest stage of the epidemic. Additionally, this finding conveys the promissory conclusion that rapid policy intervention and other efforts to limit contagion would perhaps be most effective in the US, as they would take effect earlier on in the trajectory of the disease and its growth. Indeed, considering the dramatically higher confirmed case count in the US relative to all other nations, policy intervention would likely have dramatic effects on COVID-19 contagion in America. </span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span>Interestingly, the </span><span class="c5">later</span><span>&nbsp;growth rates - but not the </span><span class="c5">early</span><span>&nbsp;ones - of COVID-19 in many countries significantly correlates negatively with quality of healthcare, and positively with democratic index, a measure for the degree to which a country is democratic (Figure 5). That is, the relative growth of the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases tends to be lower in countries with better healthcare and higher in countries with higher democracy scores during the </span><span class="c5">later</span><span>&nbsp;time window. However, both the </span><span class="c5">early </span><span>and </span><span class="c5">later </span><span>growth rates of COVID-19 did not significantly correlate with population density across these same countries.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c6 c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c6 c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">Global Policy Identification and Analysis</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c4">After a thorough review of the policy strategies and their orders of implementation by China and South Korea, we identified 6 major policy actions that characterize significant portions of each countries&rsquo; approach thus far: residential lockdown, increase of testing, hospital construction, medical supply acquisition, location tracking of positive patients, and school closure. Figure 6A shows if/when these policies were implemented in terms of days since the first case, plotted against the total number of confirmed cases in each country. </span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span>South Korea&rsquo;s rapid initiatives in widespread testing for cases and tracing of possible disease transmission sites (accomplished through location tracking apps that identified and warned of public locations that confirmed patients had recently been) is believed to have helped stymie the growth rate before it could dramatically increase </span><span><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?qDU8ST&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1592855522454000">(Fisher &amp; Sang-Hun, 2020)</a></span><span>.

China first attempted to contain the disease through extensive lockdown (with location-tracking used to restrict contact with COVID-19 carriers) (</span><span><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?lTLHv3&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1592855522455000">Kupferschmidt et al.</a></span><span>), and later through the rapid construction of makeshift hospitals </span><span><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?yFuXiZ&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1592855522455000">(Allen-Ebrahimian, 2020; , 2020; Umlauf, 2020; Yuliya Talmazan, 2020)</a></span><span class="c4">. China, however, implemented policy action relatively much later than South Korea, which may aid in explaining why China&rsquo;s confirmed case count grew for much longer before beginning to flatten (Figure 6B). China&rsquo;s delay in taking significant policy action and eventual control of the spread of COVID-19 may bode well for countries like the U.S. and Italy; as evidenced by Figure 6B, both the U.S. and Italy began to implement some of the major policy interventions before China did, meaning that there could be a possibility of slowing the exponential growth rate of the virus in or before the 120 days it took China to do so (Figure 1B). </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this point the efficacy of various policy strategies has been considered qualitatively. Although it is impossible - both qualitatively and quantitatively - to discern causative impacts of legislation on COVID-19 growth, we determined the average number of days after policy onset at which there were significant decreases in the growth of COVID-19 (Figure 7). For the policies for which we performed this analysis - medical supply acquisition and widespread school closure - there was no significant difference in the number of days after policy onset at which the growth of COVID-19 decreased. Remarkably, however, the mean number of days for both policy types was incredibly small: 4.6 days and 3.6 days, respectively (standard error = 2.99, 1.44, respectively). This finding exhibits the malleability of the COVID-19 growth rate: these policies may have rapid, perhaps even demonstrable effects on growth rate that operates on the time scale of days. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Discussion</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9 c6 c5">Existing Policy Measures</span></p><p class="c3"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the six major policy interventions we identified in South Korea, Italy, and China, the US has thus far incorporated three of them: ramped COVID-19 testing, medical supply acquisition, and school closure.

Indeed, the population density, quality of healthcare, and type of government (democratic vs authoritarian) differ dramatically among the countries we have analyzed, and in many cases, correlate significantly with the recent growth rates of the total confirmed COVID-19 cases. For these reasons, we do not simply argue that the remaining policy measures we identified in the previous section be opportunistically pursued by US public officials.

The relative capacities for nations to rapidly construct hospitals may begin to explain the correlation of healthcare index and decreased growth rates of confirmed case counts in </span><span class="c5">later </span><span>time periods. </span><span>A second potential policy measure available to the US is a cohesive, federally-driven residential lockdown procedure akin to the one utilized by other countries, especially those with lower democratic indices, who have successfully decreased their growth rate. However, legal battles regarding the federal government&rsquo;s authority to enact lockdown procedures remain controversial: advocates for a federal lockdown drawn on Section 264 of Title 42 of the U.S. Code, which states that &ldquo;the Surgeon General&hellip; is authorized to make and enforce such regulations as in his judgement are necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the States or possessions, or from one State or possession into any other State or possession&rdquo; </span><span class="c6"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?UivfRh&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1592855522460000">(Regulations to control communicable diseases, </a></span><span>1944)</span><span>.

After comparing the relative developing and aggregate confirmed case, death, and recovery counts, we then linearly fit the logarithmized number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 during two windows of time: an </span><span class="c5">early </span><span>period, corresponding to the initial growth of the disease, and a </span><span class="c5">later </span><span>period, corresponding to the growth of the disease in recent weeks. Using these findings, </span><span>we categorize these affected nations into three categories: those that have curbed the epidemic - China and South Korea, those that have yet to curb the epidemic but are experiencing decreasing growth in confirmed COVID-19 cases - Italy, Germany, and Spain, and those that have yet to curb the epidemic but are experiencing increasing growth in confirmed COVID-19 cases, indicating their relatively early stage in the epidemic - the US. For 12 affected nations, we further found that the </span><span class="c5">later </span><span>growth rates - but not the </span><span class="c5">early </span><span>ones - correlated positively with the relative democraticness of affected nations and negatively with the quality of healthcare, and that both the </span><span class="c5">early </span><span>and </span><span class="c5">later </span><span>growth rates did not correlate with a nation&rsquo;s population density.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c4">Finally, we quantified the relative timeliness of various policy implementations enacted by four countries (US, Italy, South Korea, and China), identifying six major policies shared among many of the countries. Our analysis of the changing log-linear growth rate relative to the dates of policy implementation indicates the potential capacity for legislative intervention to have dramatic influences on the COVID-19 growth rate. Ultimately, by characterizing both the relative statuses of COVID-19 and policy interventions in affected nations, our findings establish an empirical foundation for the abstraction of globally-sourced policy measures for use in individual countries.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8">A</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 451.41px; height: 310.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image8.png" style="width: 451.41px; height: 310.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">B</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 472.38px; height: 325.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 472.38px; height: 325.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Figure 1.
